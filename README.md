# StudyMeet - A Platform for Study Groups

Description: StudyMeet is a platform that allows you to create, find and join study groups. 
Study groups are meant to be chatrooms with specific information: Group name, description, degree course, location/university and group type.
You can search for groups via a filter function. For the platform, an account is needed to join groups.

In this repository, you will find initial implementations of the landing page, the chat function and backend for log in. A database based on mostly MySQL is also included.
